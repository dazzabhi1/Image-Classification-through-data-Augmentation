# Image-Classification-through-data-Augmentation
Classification of oxford17 datatset 

In this project , we will look into one such image classification problem namely Flower Species Recognition, which is a hard problem because there are millions of flower species around the world. As we know machine learning is all about learning from past data, we need huge dataset of flower images to perform real-time flower species recognition.  We explore and compare multiple solutions to the problem of data augmentation in image classification. 

The work has demonstrated the effectiveness of data augmentation through simple techniques, such as cropping, rotating, and flipping input images. Then we use different transformation techniques. We propose a method to allow  to learn augmentations that best improve the classifier. The results of the comparison emphasize the fact that the accuracy and performance of the system improves, especially in the datasets which consist of a large number of images.
